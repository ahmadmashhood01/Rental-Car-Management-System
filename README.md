# Rental Car Management System

The implementation of a Rental Car Management System in this project involves the utilization of Streamlit, a popular open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science, and PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system. Streamlit is employed to create an interactive and user-friendly interface for managing rental car operations, while PostgreSQL serves as the robust backend database to store and manage the relevant data pertaining to the rental car system. This integration of Streamlit and PostgreSQL enables the development of a comprehensive and efficient solution for the management and administration of rental car services, encompassing functionalities such as vehicle inventory management, customer information storage, rental transaction processing, and reporting capabilities.
